                Grace 老師,<br />
                <br />
                We didn't have much time to talk yesterday but,
                I just wanted to let you know that I really
                appreciate the time and effort you dedicated
                to teaching me. I feel that our private sessions
                really helped me a lot, and I owe it to your
                attention, knowledge and unwavering patience.
                I'm all the more grateful because I know you've
                been very busy, which reminds me I should apologize
                again for missing that one class... m(__)m<br />
                <br />
                So thank you, again. For the lessons, for the
                for the willingness to share a bit of
                your private life and your view of Taiwan; for the
                interest you expressed in me and my home country, for
                answering all my questions and for teaching me
                麻將 (my mother will be proud!). I will definitely 
                miss your cute British accent and the way you say
                "oh rly?" when I tell you something weird about Israel. (^_^")<br />
                <br />
                I hope you find great success in your studies, you
                are working hard so I know you can achieve your goals! (加油!)
                And I hope we can meet again in the future. You
                are always welcome in Israel!!<br />
                <br />
                Muchas gracias, 多多保重!<br />
                Ben
