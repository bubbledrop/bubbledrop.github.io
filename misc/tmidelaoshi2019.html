                Dear 涓, Serena, Grace, Ryan and the gang,
            </p>
            <p>
                I was a bit worried coming to Taiwan. I'm not the best at
                learning languages, I feel very uncomfortable struggling in
                public and my confidence in being able to learn and especially
                speak was pretty low.<br />
                You all made this process so much easier for me and
                I really wanted to thank you for it. I felt very safe
                in all my classes, which is certainly not normal for me.
                Your collective sensitivity, passion, patience and kindness
                really encouraged me to allow myself to try, and I think
                I learned a great deal during my stay thanks to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought I was coming to learn Chinese, but I feel like
                I learned so much more. Just by talking and studying day
                after day, you painted for me in bits in pieces a bridge to
                a new culture and a new mindset, with each adding their
                individual flavor to the mix. To hear about your lives,
                your interests and dreams, was fascinating for me.
                I'm always struggling with the question of "can we get along,
                or are we just too different?", and meeting you gave me more
                confidence that we can get along and be friends, despite
                being born across the world from each other. And I know that
                we're officially not supposed to be, but I left my contact
                details at the bottom of the page in case any of you would
                like to stay in touch (as I would be very happy to).
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I wanted to give you something back, to share a part of
                myself and my world with you, beyond what my basic Chinese skills
                allowed me to express in class. I thought that sharing a song
                I really relate to, which also gives a sneak peek at life in my
                home country, would be a nice token of my appreciation, small
                though it may be.
            </p>

                <b>A bit about the song:</b><br />
                Israel has been in a state of war pretty much since its inception
                in 1948. I won't go into too much detail, it's a long and complicated
                and painful story we can save for another time. The bottom line is
                that Israel has had to go to war about once a decade throughout
                its existence.
            </p>

            <p>
                The writer of this song is a famous Israeli author named
                <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E5%8D%AB%C2%B7%E6%A0%BC%E7%BD%97%E6%96%AF%E6%9B%BC">
                David Grossman</a> (you can probably find some of his books in Chinese).
                He lost his son during the 2nd Lebanon War (2006), which was a rough
                period for the Israeli public. This song is an extended
                metaphor poem about his son (and other boys like him),
                represented by the spring. <br />
                The song doesn't complain, but resignedly accepts and laments the 
                reality in which such young people have to die at war. It just
                hints at the unfairness of the situation without offering any 
                resolution. Over the years, the pain of bereavement has sprouted
                in Israel a genre of similar 'memorial songs'. They're very sad
                but I like them a lot!
            </p>

                The singer is a (domestically) venerated Israeli singer named Yehuda
                Poliker. He sings only in Hebrew (and a bit of Greek), but you may
                still be able to enjoy

                        and all nature rejoices unchained<br />
                        so vital and free, so boisterous and wild<br />

                        a vibrant young spring blooming bright in the storm<br />
                        with its doom spelled in each of its buds<br />
                        still in flight it does swirl, like a moth to the warm<br />
                        and as foolishly thinks it's for good<br />
                        <br />
                        so breathless and brief, and the heart cannot bear<br />

                        sadly only he won't understand it<br />
                        how fleetingly short is his life<br />
                        the breath of a life he was granted<br />
                        <br />
