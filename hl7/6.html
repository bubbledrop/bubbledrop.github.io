        <h1>The MSH segment</h1>
        <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 3.1vh; color: yellow">
            MSH|^~\&amp;|GHH LAB|ELAB-3|GHH OE|BLDG4|200202150930||ORU^R01|CNTRL-3456|P|2.4&lt;CR&gt;
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Other important information which may be obtained from the MSH segment:
                <ul class="sub">
                    <li>
                        MSH-3 (sending application), MSH-4 (sending facility),
                        MSH-5 (receiving application), MSH-6 (receiving facility).
                        May be informative when appropriately configured.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MSH-11 specifies the HL7 version and is important for interoperability
                        across different versions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MSH is the only segment that is mandatory in all HL7 messages.</li>
            <li>
                As explained before, the MSH-9 field (here "ORU^R01") declares the message type
                and must be read to properly parse all following segments.
                There are over 100 different HL7 message types, categorized by type (the first
                three letters, here ORU stands for "observation result") and further subindexed
                (here R01).
            </li>
        </ul>
