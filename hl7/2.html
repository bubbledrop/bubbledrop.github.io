        <h1>What is HL7 (cont.)</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: 3.5vh">
            <li>
                Some widely pervasive HL7 standards are:
                <ul class="sub">
                    <li>v2.x messaging standard (textual). Currently most prevalent in healthcare institutions.</li>
                    <li>v3 messaging standard (XML-based). Supposedly abandoned by many vendors.</li>
                    <li>SPL (Structured Product Labeling) - info about medication, based on v3.</li>
                    <li>FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) - draft for a more modern messaging standard.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="courier.png" align="right" height="150vh" />
                The HL7 messaging standards will be of greatest interest to us. These can be thought
                of as healthcare couriers. That is, events happening in the physical medical world
                will trigger HL7 messages when they need to be communicated between devices: a measurement
                taken, a patient admitted into one of the departments, medication perscribed etc.
                It is an event-driven protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
                We expect the vast majority of such messaging traffic encountered within hospital networks
                to use the v2.x messaging standard, and we will therefore lend ourselves to the common
                abuse of terminology and use the name "HL7" to refer to it unless otherwise noted.
