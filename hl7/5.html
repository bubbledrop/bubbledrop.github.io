        <h1>Message structure (cont.)</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: 3vh">

                The fields are labeled per segment. In the header (MSH segment),
                the letters MSH are the first field, and may therefore be treated as MSH-0.
                The field separator (the pipe symbol from before) is MSH-1, and the
                remaining delimiters (^~\&amp;) are MSH-2.
            </li>
            <li>
                A typical header looks something like:
                <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 3vh; color: yellow">
                    MSH|^~\&amp;|GHH LAB|ELAB-3|GHH OE|BLDG4|200202150930||ORU^R01|CNTRL-3456|P|2.4&lt;CR&gt;
                </div>
                Note that the security field (MSH-8) is empty ("unpopulated"), which in general is valid.
                MSH-9 is the message type field, which determines which segments
                one should expect in the remainder of the message, what their
                order will be and what fields they will contain. The order and
                data types of the fields in every kind of HL7 message are defined
                by the standard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Segments can either be solitary or part of a <strong>segment group</strong>.
                Solitaries or groups are defined as either mandatory, [optional], {repeating}
                or [{optional and repeating}] (0 or more). This kind of notation is called
                <strong>segment notation</strong>. A valid message must adhere to both the
                sequential order of the segments and the quantitative specifications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Segments starting with the letter Z are called <strong>Z segments</strong> and
                are reserved by the protocol for extensions. Proprietary protocols based on HL7 are
                encouraged to use Z segments for their superstandard data. Similarly, one can
                extend a segment with additional fields, provided they appear at the end of the
                standard-specified segment.
