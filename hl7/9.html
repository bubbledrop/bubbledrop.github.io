        <h1>Interoperability</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: 3.5vh">
            <li>
                The HL7 standard specifies simple interoperability guidelines, such as
                the use of Z segments and additional fields.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upon encountering a newer version of HL7, an HL7 device should: (1) Ignore
                any incoming messages not supported by its own version of HL7. (2) Within
                supported messages, ignore segments it has not had defined or that are out of order.
                (3) Within supported segments, ignore fields past the original specification of the
                segment in the context of the current message.
            </li>
            <li>
                In practice, many vendors implement HL7 differently (without respecting
                interoperability guidelines like Z-objects).
            </li>
            <li>
                Most healthcare institutions employ an HL7 translator, called an
                <strong>interface engine</strong> to bridge the language gap between the
                different devices.
            </li>
            <li>
                The interface engine must be updated to understand every new device,
                and forwarding rules established.
            </li>
        </ul>
