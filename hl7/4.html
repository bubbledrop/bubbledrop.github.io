        <h1>Message structure</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: 3.5vh">
            <li>
                An HL7 message is divided into <strong>segments</strong>,
                separated by the &lt;CR&gt; (ASCII 0x0d) character.
                Every segment starts with a 3 character acronym [A-Z][A-Z0-9]{2},
                the <strong>segment ID</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first segment of the message is special and is called the <strong>header</strong>.
                It begins with the letters MSH.
            </li>
            <li>
                The MSH part of the header is immediately followed by 5 characters
                called the <strong>separators</strong> or <strong>delimiters</strong>.
                They can be customized, but their recommended and most commonly used values
                are "|^~\&amp;" (minus the quotes).
            </li>
            <li>
                The first character is called the <strong>field/composite delimiter</strong>.
                The second is called the <strong>component delimiter</strong>.
                The third is called the <strong>repetition separator</strong>.
                The fourth is called the <strong>escape character</strong>.
                The fifth is called the <strong>sub-component separator</strong>.
                The standard defines no further subdivision after sub-components.
            </li>
        </ul>
